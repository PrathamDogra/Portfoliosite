        <p>I am Pratham and I am a programmer with intermediate knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My programming journey began 5 years ago with C++, soon in college I switch to C(as C was in my college curriculum) and then eventually Python(worked with Tkinter and Scikit-learn). Around 3 months back I made a tryst with Front End web-development and got awestruck by its potential. Ever since I have worked on React, Django and Angular. This website is a glimpse of my work.My knowledge is perhaps novice at present time and I have a log way to go, but my direction is correct as I spent relentless amount of time in discovering the right direction.</p>   
          <p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep, </p>
          <p>But I have promises to keep, </p>
          <p>And miles to go before I sleep, </p>
